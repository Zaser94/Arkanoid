Merzouga:
Basically, after finishing my master degree I want to perfom my game development skills, 
specially practising level design, so I made an open world survival game located in a dangerous alien desert. 
	- The main mechanic is surviving the extreme temperature by extracting liquid from enviromental elements (plants, liquid deposits)
	  or find any shadow or shelter.
    - Temperature affect your movement, and cause visions, headaches and so on
	- I did an intro low cost cinematic (you can see it in the trailer)
	- The shadow check is dinamic. I placed a quite far away target point who simulates the sun location.
	From that point a raycast is throwed right to the player's head every few seconds. 
	- A colossal mothership has been crashed. It carried thousands of Pilgrims (alien race) whom tried to reach the Solar Temple.
	  The trip was insure so, the Astronomic Interdimensional Inssurance Company send you to locate any surviver and
	  guide them to the Solar Temple.
	- So that there is a huge amount of corpses all over the desert. I made a tool for placing N corpses randomly in a dinamic area 
	  at construction time (before the game begins). It use raycasting and get the normal vector from every calculated ground point.
	- I did 3 Artificial Inteligent characters: huge worms, wolfs and a fox who perfom the role of the classic companion who appears sometimes 
	  and help the player with good advices. Rather than Behaviour Trees I used just a machine state inside a custom AI controller class.
	- I developed a tracker machine for helping player find the survivals. Its a round robot who moves straight forward
		and sign any suvivor by VFX. You can throw 3, the come back to you if don't find anything.
	- The game development is close but the game design requires some iterations and playstesting.

Hit & Rush:
	- When I entered Blackmouth they were finishing a migration from and old UE version to the classic 4.25.
      So that, during my first months in this company I resolved a huge amount of bugs while I learn about the
	  project complex structure. The most funny bugs where the ones related to gameplay: chest doesnt spawn objects,
	  grenades doesn't explode, the camera missbehave with collisions, etc.
	- In the recent months we have been doing an almost complete rework of the class main structure game, there were a lot of bugs and low quality code
    - Shooting rework. I re-implement partially the shooting system improving so much the legibility and flow.
	  With have 9 different weapons each of them has like 20 game design parameters like the range, damage, recoil, fire rate, 
	  . At the beginning of the game I read that excels and initialises every weapon.
	- Some weapons like the sniper use projectiles. Unreal Engine Default's collision system doesn't work with 
	high speed projectiles so I did my own collision system based on casting a capsule between bullet's position in each frame.
