- A vector is a presentation of a direction associated with a magnitude while a scalar is just a magnitude.
- The Zero Vector: 0 length, no direction
- Any vector * scalar 0 = Vector Zero
- Addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication between two vectors don't require a coordinate system reference.

A * B = |A| * |B| * cos 0
